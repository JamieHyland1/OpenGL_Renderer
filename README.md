# OpenGL_Renderer
A 3D renderer built with OpenGL, I started this because I finished the pikuma 3D graphics course. It was a really fun test in building a 3d engine from scratch, so now Im going to try integrate OpenGL! Wish me Luck :')


# Hello Triangle
So I started my journey into openGL by doing the old faithful "Hello Triangle". It actually took a longer to get up and running than I imagined. The tutorial uses GLFW for its setup and window initialization but I went with SDL2 as its what I used for my CPU based renderer and I found it hard to find tutorials whenever I got stuck.

I wanted to do a bit more for my first commit in this project. So I decided to write a wrapper class to handle loading my vertex and fragment shaders with some functions to handle updating uniforms when running shaders. I'm excited to learn more and have plenty of ideas of things I want to try implement!
